## Implementation of an Internet connected table lamp

This project is an implementation of an Internet of things enabled table lamp. The table lamp works in two modes, firstlyBluetooth control mode, secondly motion detection mode. The sensor values from the PIR sensor are sent to Amazon Web Serviceâ€™s IoT web console where it can be further processed. Here the user sends the value to AWS Simple Notification Service which notifies the user if there is motion present via an email.
